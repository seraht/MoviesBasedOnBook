<h1> Movies Based On Book Project </h1>

<h2> Is is possible to predict a success of a book-based movie by the book's description? </h2>


<b>Data Sources</b>

To get the data we used 3 sources of information:

- The site of the mid-Continent Public Library to get the list of all the movies based on books.
- Imdb Api: for the rating of the movies.
- Google book Api: for the description of the books
